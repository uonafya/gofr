Important The design document outlines the next steps in the creation of GOFR based on community feedback. If you have ZenHub installed, you may view the 2021 roadmap . Features GOFR is a GUI on top of the popular and open source HAPI FHIR Server that makes it easier to manage lists of facilities, their hierarchies, services, and attributes. It supports: CSV, DHIS2, and FHIR servers as data sources. Nested lists, ie. facilities that are administrative hierarchies like state->county->hospital. An API and backend engine that use FHIR Location resources based on the mCSD profile. Modular system to extend algorithms for matching. Many new features in addition to the above are planned for completion in 2021. Contributing and community For immediate support, join the #gofr channel on the iHRIS Slack team. For open monthly discussions, join the OpenHIE Facility Registry Community . Search through or create an issue .

The profiling of base resources for use cases are increasingly specified in machine-computable FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs). The terms 'profile' and 'implementation guide' may be used interchangeably, though profiles for FHIR are increasingly being specified in Implmentation Guides. The mCSD profile describes four entities and how they exchange information and work together. Here are the key takeaways about them. mCSD Facility (Location and Organization) First, it is important to say that we often think of health facilities as a single concept, such as physical sites such as hospitals, clinics, health outposts, physician offices, etc. In this way of thinking, a facility has a unique identifier, geographic attributes (address, geocode), contact attributes, attributes regarding its hours of operation, etc. But, in FHIR there is no single facility resource, rather each Facility is defined by a pairing of FHIR Location and FHIR Organization . All of the attributes required can be included, but there is no 'Facility' FHIR resource. A mCSD facility is defined as a FHIR Location + FHIR Organization pair The key takeaway is that when thinking of a health facility, there no single FHIR resource, instead it is represented in FHIR as a Location and Organization resource pair. FHIR Locations are physical places where care can be delivered such as facilities, buildings, wards, rooms, or vehicles. Locations also include political administrative units such as a village districts or regions. A Location has a unique identifier and may have geographic attributes (address, geocode), attributes etc. Each Location may be related to one Organization. A location may have a hierarchical relationship with other locations. Locations only relate to one organization The key takeaway is that a FHIR Location doesn't have enough details to describe the management side of the facility and that's where Organization comes in. FHIR Organizations are \"umbrella\" entities; these may be considered the administrative bodies under whose auspices care services are provided such as Healthcare Information Exchanges (HIEs), Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs), Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) or even a one-physician family practice. An organization has a unique identifier and may have additional administrative attributes such as contact person, mailing address, etc. Departments of an institution, or other administrative units, may be represented as child Organizations of a parent Organization. Organizations can have more than hierarchy, but not Locations Organizations are powerful representaions, they can have more than one hierarchy in mCSD. (This requires a mCSD extension to the core FHIR spec.) *mCSD Jurisdictions are also the pairing of a Location and Organization. However, they do not directly provide care, rather than are authoritative entities. FHIR Healthcare Services and Practitioners Healthcare Service \u2013 Each healthcare service has a unique identifier. Examples include surgical services, antenatal care services, or primary care services. The combination of a Healthcare Service offered at a Location may have specific attributes including contact person, hours of operation, etc. Think of health workers and the services they and the Locations providing them separately FHIR Practitioners are health workers; a Practitioner might be a physician, nurse, pharmacist, community health worker, district health manager, etc. Practitioners have contact and demographic attributes. Each Practitioner may be related to one or more Organizations, one or more Locations and one or more Healthcare Services. !!! tip \"Practitioners' skillsets (Practitioner Roles) and Practitioners themselves are separate. How mCSD entities relate to one another The following graphic borrowed directly from the mCSD profile shows the relationships between entities. The concept of a facility is really a Location and an Organization. Organizations and Locations may be partOf other Locations and Organizations. Services are provided by Organizations but delivered at 'Facilities'. Practitioners and Locations have a managingOrganization .","title":"Basics of mCSD"},{"location":"working_with_fhir/mcsd/#basics-of-mcsd","text":"A guiding tenant of the evolving FHIR standard is that 80% of interoperability use cases should be satisfied out-of-the-box by any combination of the more than 130 base resources.

The FHIR standard defines data structures, termed 'resources' -- like Patient, Diagnostic Result, and Care Plan -- and how these resources can be exchanged using common Web protocols. FHIR describes both a REST API based on common requests/queries and more than 130 data structures. There are many resources for learning FHIR, and the basics are covered elsewhere. A hosted demo system can be used to increase your understanding of FHIR basics. FHIR Resource types are often capitalized to help identify them in text, e.g. Location, Organization, Practitioner, HealthcareService, and PractitionerRole. Some great resources for learning are: The HAPI FHIR Test Server The test server has a great web interface so you don't need to dig into a terminal to issues commmands. This is a great way to understand the REST API and the diverse types of resources. SmileCDR's Intro to FHIR . This is a video that explains the why and how of FHIR. Core FHIR Resources The below graphic shows the relevant FHIR resources for GOFR. The core FHIR resources provide a robust framework for linking patients with when, where, how, and why they receive care. For example, Healthcare Services resources possess providedBy and location references for the respective Organizations and Locations. A HealthcareService resource or Location can be queried using existing search methods to identify the services provided. Another example of FHIR's maturity is that Practitioner and PractitionerRole are separate resources. As noted in the FHIR R4 specification : \"Practitioner performs different roles within the same or even different organizations. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner Resource for each such role or have a single Practitioner with multiple roles. The role can be limited to a specific period, after which authorization for this role ends.\" Locations are the physical places where care occurs. Organizations are managing entities of HealthcareServices, Locations, PractitionerRoles, and of other resources. Simple FHIR JSON Example As a simple introduction, consider the following snippet from here . Here are the key takeaways: Its resourceType is bundle, meaning it can contain multiple resources, and of different types. This bundle is of type collection, meaning it just for reference. It has two entries, meaning individual resources, both of resourceType is location. The bundle has an id , but so does each location resource. resource.partOf links the two resources. Location/3 is part of Location/2. This is important. It nests the resources. { \"resourceType\" : \"Bundle\" , \"id\" : \"3ad0687e-f477-468c-afd5-fcc2bf897819\" , \"type\" : \"collection\" , \"entry\" : [ { \"fullUrl\" : \"http://hl7.org/fhir/Location/2\" , \"resource\" : { \"resourceType\" : \"Location\" , \"id\" : \"2\" , \"status\" : \"active\" , \"name\" : \"USSS Enterprise-D\" , \"mode\" : \"instance\" } }, { \"fullUrl\" : \"http://hl7.org/fhir/Location/3\" , \"resource\" : { \"resourceType\" : \"Location\" , \"id\" : \"3\" , \"status\" : \"active\" , \"name\" : \"USSS Enterprise-D Sickbay\" , \"mode\" : \"instance\" , \"partOf\" : { \"reference\" : \"Location/2\" , \"display\" : \"USS Enterprise\" } } } ] }","title":"Working with FHIR"},{"location":"working_with_fhir/working_with_fhir/#working-with-fhir","text":"The HL7\u00ae FHIR\u00ae (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard defines how healthcare information can be exchanged between different systems.
